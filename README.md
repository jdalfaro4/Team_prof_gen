## Description

This program was extremely difficult and very necessary to receive help through all resources. The file stuctur alone was necessary to maintain organization. Many many many linking to other files was necessary for completion. However I don't think I've had a challenge yet that has made me feel more accomplished as a programmer then having completed this one. This challenge made me feel as if I have fully been integrated into the full stack web developement world. 

It has room for improvement and I will work on just that as my programming life evolves.
